# Algorithm Solutions Repository

## 📜 Overview
Welcome to the Algorithm Solutions Repository! This repository contains a collection of solutions to various algorithmic challenges organized into four distinct directories. Each directory focuses on different themes, showcasing a range of skills and approaches to problem-solving.

## 🗂️ Directory Structure

- **math-skills/** 🧮

- **guess-it-1/** 🎲

- **linear-stats/** 📈

- **guess-it-2/** 🎲 

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/karodgers/Algorithm.git

   ```
2. **Navigate to a Directory**:
