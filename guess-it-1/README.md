# GUESS-IT-1

## Overview

This program reads a sequence of numbers from standard input and predicts a range in which the next number should fall. It utilize statistical calculations (mean, standard deviation) to make accurate guesses.

## Objectives

- Predict number ranges based on given input data.
- Calculate the optimal range for the next number in a sequence.
- Balance the size of the range with prediction accuracy to maximize performance.

## Program Description

## Usage

To use the program, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/karodgers/guess-it-1.git
   cd guess-it-1
    ```
2. **Testing** 

The program has to be thoroughly tested to ensure accuracy and performance. A test script can be downloaded from here (https://assets.01-edu.org/guess-it/guess-it-dockerized.zip) to verify the correctness of the range predictions. 
The script runs the program with predefined datasets and checks the output against expected results.
You can comapare the guesses by comparing the percentage of correct guesses.
